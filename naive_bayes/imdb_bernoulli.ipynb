      " ' steven spielberg s   amistad     which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship   then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who   owned   them   is concerned with several different aspects of this story    first   the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery    second   it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case   including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams   anthony hopkins      last   and most importantly   it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade       amistad   succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements    i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another   anti slavery   movie    having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery   i doubted that there was much i didn t already know about it    fortunately   i turned out to be wrong    for one thing   spielberg s camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders  operations in africa   so   amistad   was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning    and some of the images here are   in fact   much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery    one scene in the middle   in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their   excess   slaves by throwing them overboard to drown   has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year    spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would   and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc 17 rating    the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians   such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain   whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time    exposing politicians as narrow minded   opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff   of course   but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation    the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time   such that john quincy adams   and probably other politicians like him     who clearly disapproved of the practice   was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court    the biggest success of   amistad   is probably the characterization of cinque   djimon hounsou     who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin   matthew mcconaughey     the lawyer who represents them in court    through cinque   we are given a window into the native culture   as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member   or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ    cinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that   again   contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles       what kind of country is this   where laws  almost  work     he asks baldwin in bewilderment   when he learns that the case must be re tried before the supreme court    spielberg s direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times   such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque s angry outburst in the court room    still   there isn t enough of this for it to be a serious problem    the main flaw in this film   which prevents it from earning four stars   is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can t quite handle all of these issues at the same time   so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie    this summer s contact   for example   dealt with several issues at once   but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and   most importantly   all of them were resolved at once       amistad   tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams   but it somehow feels a little forced   and in any case the speech itself   which lasts almost fifteen minutes   wears out its welcome about halfway through    perhaps the best way to describe it is this     amistad   is three four star films edited into one    almost every individual scene works   but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence   and thus is less than the sum of its parts    however   i can t honestly say how it could have been done differently   and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film   and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery    '\n",

similar love and fear of jesus    he has a rudimentary grasp of language   mouthing monosyllables and repetitions of his mother s phrases    he is taught that the world outside is fatally poisonous   his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the door    he is 35 years old in body   but a child in mind and spirit    he is the premise for bad boy bubby   a defiantly original australian movie about a man called bubby   nicholas hope   who has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment   etc     etc   then one day his father   ralph cotterill   appears    his father is a shabby down at heels priest who appears to have permanently misplaced his religion    unsurprisingly   he is not thrilled with the way   his   boy has turned out    he is   however   rather pleased at renewing his acquaintance with the mother   claire benito     and   more to the point   her ample breasts    soon they are copulating on the dingy couch   while bubby crouches   confused   in the next room   acutely aware that the mother who had devoted all her attention to him has a new interest    bubby s relationship to the world may be warped   but it is at least stable    the father s arrival disturbs his precarious balance   causing an oedipal conflict which ends  freud would be pleased  in violence and   as a result   freedom    bubby intuits from his father s arrival that the air outside is breathable   he leaves the apartment   his past   his world   behind    so far   so good    the first thirty minutes or so of bad boy bubby   which bring us to this point   are quite brilliant    the movie is at its best when its stays within the constraints of bubby s hermetic two room universe    it follows through unrelentingly on the implications of its premise   bubby is used by his mother for sex   he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat with cellophane   he is terrifed by the notion that jesus will beat him senseless if he sins    it is grim and savage and appalling   but also strangely tender  de heer   having imagined a life as bizarre as bubby s   does not exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes   but simply empathizes    he observes what it might be like    the intensity of these opening scenes   with their minimalist mise en scene   immerses us in a claustrophobic environment which seems to be a decayed stratum of our own world   and owes much to david lynch s eraserhead   not least the ambient industrial white noise of the soundtrack    for thirty minutes   the movie maintains the feel and mood of a reality that does not seem far removed from our own    then de heer lets bubby out   brings him into contact with our world   and the film never quite recovers    our unlikely hero finds himself in port adelaide   where he wanders the streets and meets people   where he suffers and learns and survives    he is seduced by a young woman from a salvation army band   how an anti social half wit with no sense of hygiene manages to get laid mere hours after his escape is not the sort of question the film encourages   wisely     he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress   he insults a traffic cop and is punched in the stomach   he shares a few beers in the back of a truck with a rock group   he is imprisoned and raped   he becomes a translator for mentally handicapped people whose speech is impaired beyond comprehension   he is loved by a motherly large breasted nurse   carmel johnson              it goes on   by turns inventive   silly   tasteless   endearing   and sometimes all of these things at once    de heer never seems to be sure how bubby should interface with the real world   the tone shifts   uneasily   from fable to realism to satire and back again    the scenes which try to touch base with a believable version of reality are the weakest   the film is best understood as a kind of parable   and   indeed   the religious implications of bubby s experiences are foregrounded   icons of jesus on the cross hang from the mother s walls   bubby dons a priest s collar stolen from his father   a church organ playing atheist lectures him on the necessity of unbelief   the woman who redeems him is named angel    the manifold stresses of our world do not shatter bubby s mind   do not fragment him into psychosis   rather   the world accomodates him   and heals him    although de heer s touch is at times overbearing   bubby s salvation is touching   what seemd at first a harsh lesson in the damaging effects of the social construction of reality becomes a na   ve humanist tale of improbable hope    a hapless rock group write a song about bubby and sing it for him and so give him the gift of community    he returns the favour when he steps on stage one night and becomes their frontman   turning the fragmented impressions of his experiences into performance art   and turning the band into a popular draw    innocence triumphs    bubby becomes a holy fool   an idiot savant   and graces us with wisdom    it s a strange turn of events   but by now we shouldn t be surprised   because bad boy bubby ain t like other movies    '\n",
